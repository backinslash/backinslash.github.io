      <description>Disclaimer: The link post and the following article is extremely graphic. Read at your own risk.
There have been countless stories of abuse in our society, and reading this post, I wanted to highlight how it&amp;rsquo;s not just us who have this problem; but the cases are highly similar as are their outcomes. The absolutely disgusting behavior occurs everywhere, and though we are no stranger to such stories, it is still worth discussion in my opinion.</description>
