      <description>I do experiment a little with Paper by 53 from time to time, actually this blog is sort of inspired by the man Michael Rose himself. I also sketch traditionally sometimes, have for many years; but looking at this, I am blown away. The patience and skill required to do something like this is just staggering. I wish one day I will have even a 10th of what Kyle has.</description>
