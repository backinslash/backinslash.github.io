      <description>Having lived in a western country for the last 5 years, maybe my views have changed on the matter. Then again, they might have just been solidified.
I have no problem with the consumption of alcohol, by a non-muslim or by a muslim. Where I have a problem with, is intoxication and the resulting stupidity that ensues. And then again, that is a personal opinion. I am glad to be living in a country where a &amp;lsquo;majority&amp;rsquo; of people won&amp;rsquo;t moan at me for my personal opinions.</description>
