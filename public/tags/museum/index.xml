      <description>On the back of so much Star Wars talk this week, here is some more, Madam Tussauds will open a Star Wars exhibition this year. Holy shit. Ok so since it is only a short walk from my office, I am probably wasting a lot of money there. DAMNIT! SHUTUP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
 Opening May 2015 Madame Tussauds London will take you to your favourite Star Wars scenes. Star Wars at Madame Tussauds will be a unique, immersive experience featuring 16 of the most famous heroes and villains in scenes from some of the most iconic moments featured in Star Wars Episodes I â€“ VI.</description>
