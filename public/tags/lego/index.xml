      <description>Where a fan goes the extra mile:
 Stoefller submitted the diorama for French lego contest, along with a fantastical story that offers an alternate take on how Boba survived falling into the Sarlacc during Return of the Jedi.
 The detail is just astonishing.

      <description>With a 96% critics rating and a 92% audience rating, you know this movie has done something right. It is a family movie, so go in obviously expecting that. But given that, I enjoyed it more than I ever imagined.
The little details, the references. The way the references were handled, even the overall main and underlying stories; typical as they were, were pretty good. Not all entertainment needs to be vulgar to make it big.</description>
