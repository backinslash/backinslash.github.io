      <description>Where a fan goes the extra mile:
 Stoefller submitted the diorama for French lego contest, along with a fantastical story that offers an alternate take on how Boba survived falling into the Sarlacc during Return of the Jedi.

 Matte paintings are fake sets that—most of the times—used to be made with plexiglass and oil paint.

The paintings were combined with live action filmed to match the perspective of the painting.</description>
