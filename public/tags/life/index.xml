      <description>I have been thinking a lot about the current state of my life. How much time I spend working, and the whole &amp;lsquo;work-life balance issue&amp;rsquo;. Personally, as a lot of others have stated before as well, I believe the whole term &amp;lsquo;work-life balance&amp;rsquo; is flawed.
As the argument goes, work is part of life, not a separate entity. And we consider life to be worth a lot less than work. After all you need to work to make a living right?</description>
