      <description>What a really thourough investigation. Every single piece of clothing (no shoes sadly) calatalogued. The little nerd in me wants to do re-runs now (No Timothy Dalton, no way!).
 Though there are 28 dinner jackets, there are 29 shirts. George Lazenby wears two different ruffled shirts with the same dinner jacket in On Her Majestyâ€™s Secret Service. Also, shoes are unfortunately missing from this infographic since they are rarely seen in the films.</description>
