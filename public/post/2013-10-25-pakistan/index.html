<p>Granted I do not reside in the country of my birth anymore, nor have I for the last 5 years. A lot of arguments have been made to me in this regard.</p>

<p><em>Pakistan is not the same as you remember it to be.</em></p>

<p><em>Thinks have changed.</em></p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>Granted those arguments are valid. And the reasons for which I left my country are still valid to this day from when I left. That still does not make me forget all the reasons I still and will continue to love my country of birth.</p>

<p>Most of the people I know will call me a &lsquo;burger&rsquo;. Derrogatory term for someone who is hoity-toity. So be it, I am who I am, and will never apologize for it.</p>

<h4 id="what-i-remember">What I remember</h4>

<p>Pakistan is walking in the streets of Lahore and getting breakfast for two for less than 10 Rupees.</p>

<p>Pakistan is the crazy bus conductors and the drivers that stop everywhere and anywhere to pick up customers.</p>

<p>Pakistan is hanging off a train travelling to Lahore from Islamabad with a friend and singing songs and smoking cigarettes like you just didn&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>It is walking for miles because you had no money even for that so-called cheap bus travel, and having a blast doing it.</p>

<p>It is the taste and smell of sand-roasted corn from a hawker in the streets.</p>

<p>It is playing cricket in the parks and streets.</p>

<p>It is sitting in a coffee house for hours on end, smoking and playing poker with friends.</p>

<p>Standing at a bridge over a stream and contemplating the meaning of life.</p>

<p>On that same bridge in the middle of the night playing a guitar while your friend sings our favourite Pearl Jam song.</p>

<p>Hikes on Margalla Hills.</p>

<p>The beauty of the Northern Valleys. Swat, Kaghan, Naran.</p>

<p>Even the messy markets of Muree. Who would have thought Iâ€™d miss that?</p>

<p>Picking fresh oranges from trees with your driver and running away pretending you are doing a big heist.</p>

<p>A guard sharing his sugar cane crop with you, or an old man sharing his tea and lunch with you after a long day of work as you take a break at the side of the road.</p>

<p>The truck-driver-hotel tea.</p>

<p>The hospitality of a <em>chota</em> (young waiter at a corner of the street restaurant) as you pull up for dinner.</p>

<p>And countless other things.</p>

<p>Things may change over time, but for me Pakistan will still be the sum of all these things and more.</p>
