      <article class="post-content">
      <p>Having lived in a western country for the last 5 years, maybe my views have changed on the matter. Then again, they might have just been solidified.</p>

<p>I have no problem with the consumption of alcohol, by a non-muslim or by a muslim. Where I have a problem with, is intoxication and the resulting stupidity that ensues. And then again, that is a personal opinion. I am glad to be living in a country where a &lsquo;majority&rsquo; of people won&rsquo;t moan at me for my personal opinions.</p>

<p>Even according to the Quran we can see:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In light of Verse 2:219 of Surah Baqrah, the Holy Quran has recognised some of its ‘benefits,’ and so, the sin of drinking is not absolutely haram. It is but a minor sin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then again I have always been severely against the state dictating how we should live our lives. If a person chooses to induldge in the minor sin, who is the state to stop him? Granted I am not saying the state lifts all the laws and let everyone do as they wish regarding killings and stealing and such, all I am saying is, do not confuse religion with state law.</p>

<p>Besides, if you are such a believer in faith?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shouldn’t faith be a stronger limitation than laws imposed by the state?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not even going into the rabbit hole of a discussion that is, &lsquo;Oh but the consumption is done semi-openly and without prosecution so why not let it be? Or legalize it?&rsquo; Though legalizing such controlled substances has its advantages, look at the countries who have done it already. Decrease in crime related to these substances, revenue generated via taxes and such.</p>

<p>One could argue if the practice of consumption already exists, why not try to profit from it? But that again is a rabbit hole of a discussion in itself.</p>

<p>So I leave it to you, to form your own opinion, and not shout at you for having a different one. Please give others the same respect and get off that fucking high horse that you mistake for being &lsquo;oh-so-righteous&rsquo;.</p>
