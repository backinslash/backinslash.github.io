  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Tolerance, or lack thereof </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Well written article over at the Tribune. I especially like the fact that the write starts to explain what her interpretation of the events of Karballa were, then leaves them out, as that is not what the post was about. It was about one thing, tolerance.
We pride ourselves in being Muslims, followers of the best religion known to mankind. And yet we are the scum of the earth. If something our our religion had actually gone through our goddamn thick skulls we would respect our fellow man&rsquo;s difference of opinion and let them live their lives in peace.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Sharing a Husband </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Got linked to this article on Facebook. What an insane story of intelligence and wisom displayed by a maid.
Granted their situation was a difficult one, and it is all on the in-laws of the widow who gave her so much difficulty in the first place, but it is inspiring to know that there are brave and intelligent people out in the world.
The problem of the widow can be summed up in this one sentence:</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Hahahahahahaha.
Ok enough making fun of the situation (not really!). We can all point fingers, but the fact of the matter is, this is extremely sad.
Quick quote:
 &ldquo;The Army lost track of roughly $5.8 billion worth of supplies between 2003 and 2011.&rdquo;
 Kind of reminds me of another army.

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">The BatKid Story </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">The internet is flush with articles on the BatKid story.
 &ldquo;The Make-A-Wish Foundation has often arranged elaborate gifts for kids with life-threatening diseases - but never at this scale&hellip;&rdquo;
&ldquo;We were here to cheer on Miles, but Miles also helped us&hellip;&rdquo;
 Stories like these start to restore my faith in humanity, but then there are always the naysayers:
 Not everyone felt the love. While city police officials said they handled Friday&rsquo;s crowds without extra staffing or costs, some thought the event focused too much energy on one child.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">The Abuses in Orthodox Communities </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Disclaimer: The link post and the following article is extremely graphic. Read at your own risk.
There have been countless stories of abuse in our society, and reading this post, I wanted to highlight how it&rsquo;s not just us who have this problem; but the cases are highly similar as are their outcomes. The absolutely disgusting behavior occurs everywhere, and though we are no stranger to such stories, it is still worth discussion in my opinion.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">The Poetry of Life </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">I have been thinking a lot about the current state of my life. How much time I spend working, and the whole &lsquo;work-life balance issue&rsquo;. Personally, as a lot of others have stated before as well, I believe the whole term &lsquo;work-life balance&rsquo; is flawed.
As the argument goes, work is part of life, not a separate entity. And we consider life to be worth a lot less than work. After all you need to work to make a living right?</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">State and Religion: The Need for Seperation </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">So following a discussion on a social media that-must-not-be-named (mainly because I hate it), I decided that a post on my opinions on the matter of State and Religion, or their seperate; was in order.
##Duties of the State
To begin this, let us first think about what the state actually means or what it is supposed to mean/do.
The responsibilities of the state can be broadly described as1:
 Protection: Ensure the safety of the people/citizens.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Alcohol the Deadly Sin </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Having lived in a western country for the last 5 years, maybe my views have changed on the matter. Then again, they might have just been solidified.
I have no problem with the consumption of alcohol, by a non-muslim or by a muslim. Where I have a problem with, is intoxication and the resulting stupidity that ensues. And then again, that is a personal opinion. I am glad to be living in a country where a &lsquo;majority&rsquo; of people won&rsquo;t moan at me for my personal opinions.</p>
