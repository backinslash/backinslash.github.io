title: The Amazon Way
---

Amazing interview. From the scale of Amazon's operations, to the forward thinking ideas (some very sci-fi), and just the general philosophy. Jeff Bezos:

> Jeff Bezos: The long term approach is rare enough that it means you're not competing against very many companies. 'Cause most companies wanna see a return on investment in, you know, one, two, three years.

> Charlie Rose: You donâ€™t care about that?

> Jeff Bezos: I care, but I'm willing for it to be five, six, seven years. So just that change in timeline can be a very big competitive advantage.

They are still in it for the money, just not at the expense of the customer, or to leech every little drop of profit in the short term. I mean they are making money of us, the customers, but why shouldn't they? They are providing an amazing service. Next-day delivery here in UK with Amazon Prime; and after using it for a year plus, I think it is just amazing. I find more and more reasons to order through Amazon than other places these days.

Granted the idea of the delivery drones might not work out to be cost-effective; but just the fact that they are trying these things is amazing. Just like Google with their famous driverless-cars and other crazy projects that make no sense in the short term, and have a lot of naysayers having a mad crazy-fest at their expense.

Jeff Bezos is a realist it seems, he knows Amazon won't be around forever, he even quotes:

> Companies have short life spans Charlie. And Amazon will be disrupted one day.

But the real fact is, with all their operations and amazing R&D that is going into delaying that day, I think this last quote sums up his philosophy perfectly:

> I would love for it to be after I'm dead.
