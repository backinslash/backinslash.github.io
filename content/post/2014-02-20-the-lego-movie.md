With a 96% critics rating and a 92% audience rating, you know this movie has done something right. It is a family movie, so go in obviously expecting that. But given that, I enjoyed it more than I ever imagined.

The little details, the references. The way the references were handled, even the overall main and underlying stories; typical as they were, were pretty good. Not all entertainment needs to be [vulgar](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_wolf_of_wall_street_2013/) to make it big.

Go watch it with your family, kids. Hell go watch it alone. Reminisce about your childhood, or just be a kid again for a day.
