Stories like these might sound sensational to you. Yes they are trying to paint a very bleak picture of our society and the kind of censorship that is prevalent. But it doesn't change the fact that it is **censorship**.

> Today's edition of The International New York Times was stripped of its cover story in Pakistan. Instead of seeing a lengthy report on "What Pakistan knew about bin Laden," readers were greeted with an enormous section of white space that dominates the paper's front page.

If we want to refute such claims we might want to go ahead and write something proving the opposite? We are free to say what we like, just as someone else. But to blatantly censor it because you don't agree with it gives it more credibility than letting it stand on it's own.
