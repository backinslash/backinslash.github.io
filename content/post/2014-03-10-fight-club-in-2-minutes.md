title: Fight Club in 2 minutes
---

Fight Club is, and always will be one of my favourite movies. Call it a hunger for violence, or a passion for dark gritty stories. I don't care, I love this movie. And for you who can't stand the original because of its violence (I pity you!), go ahead and watch this 2 minute version.

It blends the original story with the classic Sega games like Streets of Rage style graphics, classic!
