title: Madame Tussauds Star Wars Exhibition
---

On the back of so much Star Wars talk this week, here is some more, Madam Tussauds will open a Star Wars exhibition this year. Holy shit. Ok so since it is only a short walk from my office, I am probably wasting a lot of money there. DAMNIT! SHUTUP AND TAKE MY MONEY!

> Opening May 2015 Madame Tussauds London will take you to your favourite Star Wars scenes. Star Wars at Madame Tussauds will be a unique, immersive experience featuring 16 of the most famous heroes and villains in scenes from some of the most iconic moments featured in Star Wars Episodes I â€“ VI.
