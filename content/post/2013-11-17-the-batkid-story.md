title: The BatKid Story
---

The internet is flush with articles on the [BatKid](http://www.sfchronicle.com/batkid/#/0) story. 

> "The Make-A-Wish Foundation has often arranged elaborate gifts for kids with life-threatening diseases - but never at this scale..."

> "We were here to cheer on Miles, but Miles also helped us..."

Stories like these start to restore my faith in humanity, but then there are always the naysayers:

> Not everyone felt the love. While city police officials said they handled Friday's crowds without extra staffing or costs, some thought the event focused too much energy on one child.

Just be happy for a day for one kid, yes there are countless others out there, but atleast one good thing is just that, *one good thing!*
