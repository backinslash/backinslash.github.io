title: Kyle Lambert's Art on an iPad
---

I do experiment a little with [Paper by 53](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper) from time to time, actually this blog is sort of inspired by the man [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com/paperfaces/) himself. I also sketch traditionally sometimes, have for many years; but looking at this, I am blown away. The patience and skill required to do something like this is just staggering. I wish one day I will have even a 10th of what Kyle has.

Watch. Enjoy.
