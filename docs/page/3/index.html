  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Gotham </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">As we all know, anything to do with Batman gets me excited. Being as they are about to mutilate the origin story once again, I have some very strong thoughts on the matter. Which also brings me to the linked article:
 Here’s what I WOULDN’T do in the pilot: Kill Thomas and Martha Wayne.
 Yes, yes we all know that is the defining moment in Bruce&rsquo;s career to becoming Batman.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Is Iron Man made of Lego? </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">So it seems like Tony Stark is also a fan of Lego. Or his captors are? In either case it is always pretty funny when movies/series use code copied from somewhere, but in this case it looks like one of the designers had a sense of humour.
 The code above comes from a firmware downloader for the RCX (a programmable, microcontroller-based Lego brick), written in 1998 at Stanford University by Kekoa Proudfoot.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Burger&#39;s Guide to Islamabad </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Absolutely hilarious. I love my hometown, and yes before you ask, it IS better than its twin city. Love how the writer illustrates the different divides within the city with such humour.
There are always comparions made by Lahori-ites and Karachi-ites about how their cities have so much happening, and Islamabad is boring and lame and all that. To that I would like to quote a friend, &ldquo;Jealous not, Darrrlinnnggg!!&rdquo;</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">The Official Star Wars Universe Just...Expanded </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">So this just basically means that the new movies could draw their inspiration from some of the richest stories ever told in science fiction. Hell yes!
Here&rsquo;s to hoping Disney picks up on the nerdgasms this has generated in the Star Wars community and decide to actually pick some of the most amazing story lines for the upcoming movies or animated series/films.
 So if by Episode VIII fans meet Grand Admiral Thrawn, all the better.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Finally an answer to: How long is the Runway in Fast 6? </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Totally useless bit of information, but it has nagged me since I saw the movie. My estimates were around ~26km, accounting for the scenes that could have taken place in parallel. Seems like the guys over in BBC had the same idea.
 Our best estimate after calculating plane speed, car speed and simultaneous action sequences is that the runway is 18.37 miles (29.6km) long. Which is still very long when you consider the longest paved runway in the world is the Qamdo Bamda airport in China, at around 3.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">I do experiment a little with Paper by 53 from time to time, actually this blog is sort of inspired by the man Michael Rose himself. I also sketch traditionally sometimes, have for many years; but looking at this, I am blown away. The patience and skill required to do something like this is just staggering. I wish one day I will have even a 10th of what Kyle has.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">The Amazon Way </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Amazing interview. From the scale of Amazon&rsquo;s operations, to the forward thinking ideas (some very sci-fi), and just the general philosophy. Jeff Bezos:
 Jeff Bezos: The long term approach is rare enough that it means you&rsquo;re not competing against very many companies. &lsquo;Cause most companies wanna see a return on investment in, you know, one, two, three years.
Charlie Rose: You don’t care about that?
Jeff Bezos: I care, but I&rsquo;m willing for it to be five, six, seven years.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Logic in Religion </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">I read a very thought provoking post over at Messy Thoughts and the following discussion regarding the post was insanely entertaining. Lots of self-righteousness rearing its ugly head and all that fun stuff.
Let me go over into a rant on the subject now. I have been contemplating this whole idea about Religion and Logic and blind-faith and all that stuff for a long time. I am very thankful that I had a grandfather who was very challenging in this regard, always made me question everything and always said:</p>
