  <h3 class="h2 post-title">The paintings of the Original Star Wars Trilogy </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Talk about a childhood destroyed. I always thought they created this somehow, miniatures or something. But paintings? Wow!
 Matte paintings are fake sets that—most of the times—used to be made with plexiglass and oil paint. The artists used oversized panels to create the necessary detail that the camera needed to fool the audiences when the film was projected over the large surface of the theater screen. The paintings were combined with live action filmed to match the perspective of the painting.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Hong Kong Protests </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Pro-democracy riots in Hong Kong. Note the similarities in the police actions and the reactions by the public to what is recently happening back home in Pakistan.
 The government urdged the protesters to end their sit-in demonstrations.
 Now why would people do that? Why is it that everywhere protests start &ndash; Pakistan, UK, Hong Kong, elsewhere &ndash; the authorities always have their ridiculous demands about not protesting? Why? Other than the authourities, who else benifits from not protesting?</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">For less than the price of a Hollywood movie </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">I wrote about India&rsquo;s mission to Mars a while back, and now that spaceship has finally reached Mar&rsquo;s orbit.
And all of this for less than the cost of what it took to make Gravity.
I think the New York Time&rsquo;s article say&rsquo;s it best though.
 One a shoestring, India sends orbiter to Mars on it&rsquo;s first try.
 The trip cost India $74 million. Gravity on the other hand cost $100 million.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Chris Avellone has been one of my childhood heroes since a friend of mine told me to go read the credits on our favourite game of all time, Fallout 2. Him and the other&rsquo;s who made the amazing games over at Black Isle Studios just made my childhood amazing.
I now get to see a loot at what he uses as a gaming machine and his general desk and place of work/fun, great insight.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Censorship </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Stories like these might sound sensational to you. Yes they are trying to paint a very bleak picture of our society and the kind of censorship that is prevalent. But it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that it is censorship.
 Today&rsquo;s edition of The International New York Times was stripped of its cover story in Pakistan. Instead of seeing a lengthy report on &ldquo;What Pakistan knew about bin Laden,&rdquo; readers were greeted with an enormous section of white space that dominates the paper&rsquo;s front page.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Fight Club in 2 minutes </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Fight Club is, and always will be one of my favourite movies. Call it a hunger for violence, or a passion for dark gritty stories. I don&rsquo;t care, I love this movie. And for you who can&rsquo;t stand the original because of its violence (I pity you!), go ahead and watch this 2 minute version.
It blends the original story with the classic Sega games like Streets of Rage style graphics, classic!</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">How the World Wars inspired the Millennium Falcon </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">The Millennium Falcon is no doubt some of the most recognizable nerd craft. The article traces the inspirations:
 The connections begin in the cockpit of the Falcon with its iconic greenhouse-style window. It was here that audiences first jumped to hyperspace, and from these famous viewports that Han Solo evaded Imperial ships in the asteroid field above Hoth. Thirty years earlier, this same style of cockpit was found flying aboard one of the most advanced bomber aircraft of World War II: The American B-29 Superfortress.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">The Lego Movie </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">With a 96% critics rating and a 92% audience rating, you know this movie has done something right. It is a family movie, so go in obviously expecting that. But given that, I enjoyed it more than I ever imagined.
The little details, the references. The way the references were handled, even the overall main and underlying stories; typical as they were, were pretty good. Not all entertainment needs to be vulgar to make it big.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Sacrifice </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Women All of what is written in the linked article is true, women are generally expected to make all the sacrifices for a marriage; or more accurately, trained to believe to give up all their hopes and dreams and live according to the lives their husbands choose for them.
And no matter how much we want it to be not true, it is. Even the modern woman feels the pressure from family and society to conform to these social norms.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">House of Cards and China </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Many of you watch this series, and many of you love it. It may be the acting or the overly dramatized politics. There is no doubt House of Cards is a very popular series, not even going into how amazing it is that Netflix is making such amazing original content, as that is a whole seperate post; let&rsquo;s talk about its popularity abroad.
To say Chinese people get the wrong idea of American politics by watching this series is again a half statement.</p>
