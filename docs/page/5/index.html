  <h3 class="h2 post-title">My Jekyll Setup and related things - Part 1 </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">I think finally I would like to write about how this blog is set up, for all you geeks out there, I am sure you might enjoy this.
So let us begin!
Jekyll and all that Jekyll, is a simple static blogging system, or as they say, blogging for hackers. Basically, it eliminates the database from the backend. All that is there is your content (posts) and that is it.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Feedback </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">So I have had some feedback from some of you who have read the recent posts (I know they are not a lot). And it has been most helpful.
Basic points that came out of the feedback are summarised as follows:
 Injustice posts seem to be mostly rambling. I understand that these are first drafts that were mainly published to get feedback from you guys in the first place, but that does not excuse bad quality.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">The abuse of labour </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">When we talk about abuses of women and generally labour in our country we cry foul at all stages. Women are abused, downtrodden and generally not held in the highest regard in our society. Not taking anything away from those abuses, they are horrible in their own right. But today I wanted to just talk about the post over at BBC that I read a while back. Namely, the abuse of women in Melilla, and specifically their abuse as mules for transport of goods.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Pakistan </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Granted I do not reside in the country of my birth anymore, nor have I for the last 5 years. A lot of arguments have been made to me in this regard.
Pakistan is not the same as you remember it to be.
Thinks have changed.
And so on.
Granted those arguments are valid. And the reasons for which I left my country are still valid to this day from when I left.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">On India&#39;s Mission to Mars </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Our neighbours over in India have a plan to launch a space mission to Mars.
 The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November.
 Meanwhile in Pakistan we still concern ourselves with useless issues like what our Northern province should be called?</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Injustice for All: A Little South of Sanity </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">The laughter is the first thing that gets to most people. The shriekers, the wailers. And then those who snicker as if they know something you don&rsquo;t. Makes more than a few wonder if it&rsquo;s in fact the patients who know more than you. That they are privy to secrets that you are not. Maybe feeling that way is what drives most people away from places like this. An asylum.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Injustice for All: Dusty Neighbourhood </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Flicking the cigarette and taking a swig from the half drunk cup of coffee, he sighed. Out came the smoke in misty curls. He half tried to make rings, failed miserably and gave up. He was never very good at that. Looking out the window to his scenic view, the first thing that you saw was the criss-crossed wires. Telephone wires, electricity wires, bloody everything else wires. Covered in dirt and bird shit and god knows what else.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Injustice for All </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">I have been writing short stories since I was very young. Most of them used to be nothing more than just childhood fiction. These days I am more interested in writing about certain aspects of my culture. Highlighting certain issues if you will.
The future posts that follow with the titles beginning with &ldquo;Injustice for All&rdquo;, will be part of short stories that are linked in one way or another; and where I try to fit together these disjointed stories about things that I want to highlight about my culture.</p>
