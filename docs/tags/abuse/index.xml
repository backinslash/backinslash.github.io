      <description>Disclaimer: The link post and the following article is extremely graphic. Read at your own risk.
There have been countless stories of abuse in our society, and reading this post, I wanted to highlight how it&amp;rsquo;s not just us who have this problem; but the cases are highly similar as are their outcomes. The absolutely disgusting behavior occurs everywhere, and though we are no stranger to such stories, it is still worth discussion in my opinion.</description>

      <description>When we talk about abuses of women and generally labour in our country we cry foul at all stages. Women are abused, downtrodden and generally not held in the highest regard in our society. Not taking anything away from those abuses, they are horrible in their own right. But today I wanted to just talk about the post over at BBC that I read a while back. Namely, the abuse of women in Melilla, and specifically their abuse as mules for transport of goods.</description>
