      <description>I am getting a lot of personal one-to-one feedback on the posts which is great. Just to remind you, if you want to shout at me, argue, or just have a plain discussion, all the links are in the About section. Top menu -&amp;gt; About.
I do reply to emails etc. but by far the best place to have a discussion is Twitter.
You can follow the author or shout at him on Twitter</description>

      <description>So I have had some feedback from some of you who have read the recent posts (I know they are not a lot). And it has been most helpful.
Basic points that came out of the feedback are summarised as follows:
 Injustice posts seem to be mostly rambling. I understand that these are first drafts that were mainly published to get feedback from you guys in the first place, but that does not excuse bad quality.</description>
