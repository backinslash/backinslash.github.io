      <description>I know what people say about Heroes, and no I won&amp;rsquo;t link to them. Who cares, I loved that show. And sadto see some of the original cast won&amp;rsquo;t be (and glad about some, I hated Claire&amp;rsquo;s character) but seriously watch the teaser, DAMN!

      <description>Many of you watch this series, and many of you love it. It may be the acting or the overly dramatized politics. There is no doubt House of Cards is a very popular series, not even going into how amazing it is that Netflix is making such amazing original content, as that is a whole seperate post; let&amp;rsquo;s talk about its popularity abroad.
To say Chinese people get the wrong idea of American politics by watching this series is again a half statement.</description>
