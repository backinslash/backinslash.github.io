      <description>Absolutely hilarious. I love my hometown, and yes before you ask, it IS better than its twin city. Love how the writer illustrates the different divides within the city with such humour.
There are always comparions made by Lahori-ites and Karachi-ites about how their cities have so much happening, and Islamabad is boring and lame and all that. To that I would like to quote a friend, &amp;ldquo;Jealous not, Darrrlinnnggg!!&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>So it seems like Tony Stark is also a fan of Lego. Or his captors are? In either case it is always pretty funny when movies/series use code copied from somewhere, but in this case it looks like one of the designers had a sense of humour.
 The code above comes from a firmware downloader for the RCX (a programmable, microcontroller-based Lego brick), written in 1998 at Stanford University by Kekoa Proudfoot.</description>
