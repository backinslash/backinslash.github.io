      <title>How the World Wars inspired the Millennium Falcon</title>

      <description>The Millennium Falcon is no doubt some of the most recognizable nerd craft. The article traces the inspirations:
 The connections begin in the cockpit of the Falcon with its iconic greenhouse-style window. It was here that audiences first jumped to hyperspace, and from these famous viewports that Han Solo evaded Imperial ships in the asteroid field above Hoth. Thirty years earlier, this same style of cockpit was found flying aboard one of the most advanced bomber aircraft of World War II: The American B-29 Superfortress.</description>

      <description>With a 96% critics rating and a 92% audience rating, you know this movie has done something right. It is a family movie, so go in obviously expecting that. But given that, I enjoyed it more than I ever imagined.
The little details, the references. The way the references were handled, even the overall main and underlying stories; typical as they were, were pretty good. Not all entertainment needs to be vulgar to make it big.</description>

      <description>Many of you watch this series, and many of you love it. It may be the acting or the overly dramatized politics. There is no doubt House of Cards is a very popular series, not even going into how amazing it is that Netflix is making such amazing original content, as that is a whole seperate post; let&amp;rsquo;s talk about its popularity abroad.
To say Chinese people get the wrong idea of American politics by watching this series is again a half statement.</description>

      <description>Women All of what is written in the linked article is true, women are generally expected to make all the sacrifices for a marriage; or more accurately, trained to believe to give up all their hopes and dreams and live according to the lives their husbands choose for them.
And no matter how much we want it to be not true, it is. Even the modern woman feels the pressure from family and society to conform to these social norms.</description>

      <description>I do experiment a little with Paper by 53 from time to time, actually this blog is sort of inspired by the man Michael Rose himself. I also sketch traditionally sometimes, have for many years; but looking at this, I am blown away. The patience and skill required to do something like this is just staggering. I wish one day I will have even a 10th of what Kyle has.</description>

      <description>Amazing interview. From the scale of Amazon&amp;rsquo;s operations, to the forward thinking ideas (some very sci-fi), and just the general philosophy. Jeff Bezos:
 Jeff Bezos: The long term approach is rare enough that it means you&amp;rsquo;re not competing against very many companies. &amp;lsquo;Cause most companies wanna see a return on investment in, you know, one, two, three years.
Charlie Rose: You donâ€™t care about that?
Jeff Bezos: I care, but I&amp;rsquo;m willing for it to be five, six, seven years.</description>

      <description>I read a very thought provoking post over at Messy Thoughts and the following discussion regarding the post was insanely entertaining. Lots of self-righteousness rearing its ugly head and all that fun stuff.
Let me go over into a rant on the subject now. I have been contemplating this whole idea about Religion and Logic and blind-faith and all that stuff for a long time. I am very thankful that I had a grandfather who was very challenging in this regard, always made me question everything and always said:</description>

      <description>Hahahahahahaha.
Ok enough making fun of the situation (not really!). We can all point fingers, but the fact of the matter is, this is extremely sad.
Quick quote:
 &amp;ldquo;The Army lost track of roughly $5.8 billion worth of supplies between 2003 and 2011.&amp;rdquo;
 Kind of reminds me of another army.

      <description>Got linked to this article on Facebook. What an insane story of intelligence and wisom displayed by a maid.
Granted their situation was a difficult one, and it is all on the in-laws of the widow who gave her so much difficulty in the first place, but it is inspiring to know that there are brave and intelligent people out in the world.
The problem of the widow can be summed up in this one sentence:</description>

      <description>Well written article over at the Tribune. I especially like the fact that the write starts to explain what her interpretation of the events of Karballa were, then leaves them out, as that is not what the post was about. It was about one thing, tolerance.
We pride ourselves in being Muslims, followers of the best religion known to mankind. And yet we are the scum of the earth. If something our our religion had actually gone through our goddamn thick skulls we would respect our fellow man&amp;rsquo;s difference of opinion and let them live their lives in peace.</description>

      <description>The internet is flush with articles on the BatKid story.
 &amp;ldquo;The Make-A-Wish Foundation has often arranged elaborate gifts for kids with life-threatening diseases - but never at this scale&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;We were here to cheer on Miles, but Miles also helped us&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
 Stories like these start to restore my faith in humanity, but then there are always the naysayers:
 Not everyone felt the love. While city police officials said they handled Friday&amp;rsquo;s crowds without extra staffing or costs, some thought the event focused too much energy on one child.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: The link post and the following article is extremely graphic. Read at your own risk.
There have been countless stories of abuse in our society, and reading this post, I wanted to highlight how it&amp;rsquo;s not just us who have this problem; but the cases are highly similar as are their outcomes. The absolutely disgusting behavior occurs everywhere, and though we are no stranger to such stories, it is still worth discussion in my opinion.</description>

      <description>I have been thinking a lot about the current state of my life. How much time I spend working, and the whole &amp;lsquo;work-life balance issue&amp;rsquo;. Personally, as a lot of others have stated before as well, I believe the whole term &amp;lsquo;work-life balance&amp;rsquo; is flawed.
As the argument goes, work is part of life, not a separate entity. And we consider life to be worth a lot less than work. After all you need to work to make a living right?</description>

      <title>State and Religion: The Need for Seperation</title>

      <description>So following a discussion on a social media that-must-not-be-named (mainly because I hate it), I decided that a post on my opinions on the matter of State and Religion, or their seperate; was in order.
##Duties of the State
To begin this, let us first think about what the state actually means or what it is supposed to mean/do.
The responsibilities of the state can be broadly described as1:
 Protection: Ensure the safety of the people/citizens.</description>

      <description>Having lived in a western country for the last 5 years, maybe my views have changed on the matter. Then again, they might have just been solidified.
I have no problem with the consumption of alcohol, by a non-muslim or by a muslim. Where I have a problem with, is intoxication and the resulting stupidity that ensues. And then again, that is a personal opinion. I am glad to be living in a country where a &amp;lsquo;majority&amp;rsquo; of people won&amp;rsquo;t moan at me for my personal opinions.</description>

I do reply to emails etc. but by far the best place to have a discussion is Twitter.

      <description>I think finally I would like to write about how this blog is set up, for all you geeks out there, I am sure you might enjoy this.
So let us begin!
Jekyll and all that Jekyll, is a simple static blogging system, or as they say, blogging for hackers. Basically, it eliminates the database from the backend. All that is there is your content (posts) and that is it.</description>

      <description>So I have had some feedback from some of you who have read the recent posts (I know they are not a lot). And it has been most helpful.
Basic points that came out of the feedback are summarised as follows:
 Injustice posts seem to be mostly rambling. I understand that these are first drafts that were mainly published to get feedback from you guys in the first place, but that does not excuse bad quality.</description>

      <description>The laughter is the first thing that gets to most people. The shriekers, the wailers. And then those who snicker as if they know something you don&amp;rsquo;t. Makes more than a few wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s in fact the patients who know more than you. That they are privy to secrets that you are not. Maybe feeling that way is what drives most people away from places like this. An asylum.</description>

      <description>Flicking the cigarette and taking a swig from the half drunk cup of coffee, he sighed. Out came the smoke in misty curls. He half tried to make rings, failed miserably and gave up. He was never very good at that. Looking out the window to his scenic view, the first thing that you saw was the criss-crossed wires. Telephone wires, electricity wires, bloody everything else wires. Covered in dirt and bird shit and god knows what else.</description>

      <description>I have been writing short stories since I was very young. Most of them used to be nothing more than just childhood fiction. These days I am more interested in writing about certain aspects of my culture. Highlighting certain issues if you will.
The future posts that follow with the titles beginning with &amp;ldquo;Injustice for All&amp;rdquo;, will be part of short stories that are linked in one way or another; and where I try to fit together these disjointed stories about things that I want to highlight about my culture.</description>

      <description>I read an article over at Messy Thoughts which I think is an excellent take on the issue of &amp;lsquo;useless education&amp;rsquo;. Go ahead read it first and come back, I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.
I am totally for education itself and improving oneself, but to get a degree and not use it, is an insult to education itself. Maybe you say, it is their own (or their parent&amp;rsquo;s atleast) money, and it is for them to do with as they will.</description>

      <description>I will begin this by saying I am not a writer. I have always wanted to be able to write well, but never had the drive or the energy to go ahead and do it. This blog is finally a first step in the journey to becoming a better writer.
As such, this will be a collection of all the small titbits I write, along with links and my personal comments on the articles I find interesting and those that make it to my reading lists.</description>
