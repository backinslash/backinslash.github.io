      <description>With a 96% critics rating and a 92% audience rating, you know this movie has done something right. It is a family movie, so go in obviously expecting that. But given that, I enjoyed it more than I ever imagined.
The little details, the references. The way the references were handled, even the overall main and underlying stories; typical as they were, were pretty good. Not all entertainment needs to be vulgar to make it big.</description>
