title: Sharing a Husband
---

Got linked to this article on Facebook. What an insane story of intelligence and wisom displayed by a maid.

Granted their situation was a difficult one, and it is all on the in-laws of the widow who gave her so much difficulty in the first place, but it is inspiring to know that there are brave and intelligent people out in the world. 

The problem of the widow can be summed up in this one sentence:

> "Plus the boys/men are looking for heavy dowries and what not. Shaheen has nothing to attract a new man. Plus, there is no guarantee that he will also accept her two children..."

Its sad how our communities look at widowed women and the like. They are human beings too, what if someone judged your own mother/sister/wife like that?
