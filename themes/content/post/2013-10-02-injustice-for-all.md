title: Injustice for All
---

I have been writing short stories since I was very young. Most of them used to be nothing more than just childhood fiction. These days I am more interested in writing about certain aspects of my culture. Highlighting certain issues if you will.

The future posts that follow with the titles beginning with "Injustice for All", will be part of short stories that are linked in one way or another; and where I try to fit together these disjointed stories about things that I want to highlight about my culture.

They are not about bashing Pakistan, mind you. More about, beginning the discussions on all the things we all find wrong in our society. Nothing will come of my ranting, I am sure. But as I started this writing adventure, I want to pass on what I think about as fiction.

All the stories will be made up, if they are similar to you, or to anyone you know, that's purely coincidence.
