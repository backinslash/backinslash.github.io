title: The paintings of the Original Star Wars Trilogy

Talk about a childhood destroyed. I always thought they created this somehow, miniatures or something. But paintings? Wow!

>Matte paintings are fake sets that—most of the times—used to be made with plexiglass and oil paint. The artists used oversized panels to create the necessary detail that the camera needed to fool the audiences when the film was projected over the large surface of the theater screen. The paintings were combined with live action filmed to match the perspective of the painting. If done well, the public would totally buy into the shot.
