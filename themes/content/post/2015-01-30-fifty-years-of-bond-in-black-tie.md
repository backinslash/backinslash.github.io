What a really thourough investigation. Every single piece of clothing (no shoes sadly) calatalogued. The little nerd in me wants to do re-runs now (No Timothy Dalton, no way!).

> Though there are 28 dinner jackets, there are 29 shirts. George Lazenby wears two different ruffled shirts with the same dinner jacket in On Her Majestyâ€™s Secret Service. Also, shoes are unfortunately missing from this infographic since they are rarely seen in the films.
