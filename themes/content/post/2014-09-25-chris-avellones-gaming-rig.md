title: Chris Avellone's Gaming Rig
---

Chris Avellone has been one of my childhood heroes since a friend of mine told me to go read the credits on our favourite game of all time, [Fallout 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_2). Him and the other's who made the amazing games over at [Black Isle Studios](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Isle_Studios) just made my childhood amazing.

I now get to see a loot at what he uses as a gaming machine and his general desk and place of work/fun, great insight. I especially love the fact that he has so many action figures all over the place. I wish I could do that, without getting killed! :).

And he plays Lego! Yay!

> I have LEGO partly because I grew up with LEGO, I love dumping them on the floor and building craziness, and also for the reasons above - the variations they can make in personalities and the interpretation of established characters with simple connection principles is pretty amazing.

Now to get back to dreaming about [Wasteland 2](https://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/), and not working! :)
