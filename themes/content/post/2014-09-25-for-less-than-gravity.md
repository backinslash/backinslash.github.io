I wrote about [India's mission to Mars](http://abijango.com/indias-mission-to-mars/) a while back, and now that spaceship has finally reached Mar's orbit.

And all of this for less than the cost of what it took to make [Gravity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_(film)).

I think the [New York Time's article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/world/asia/on-a-shoestring-india-sends-orbiter-to-mars.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&smid=tw-nytimes&_r=0) say's it best though.

> One a shoestring, India sends orbiter to Mars on it's first try.

The trip cost India $74 million. [Gravity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_(film)) on the other hand cost $100 million. Ironic?
